  abstract = {In applications of regression analysis for prediction purposes a large
	number of independent variables is often available. There may be
	uncertainty as to which of these independent variables should be
	included in the final analysis as adequate prediction may be possible
	using only a subset of those available. Many methods of variable
	selection have been proposed. In deciding on a method it is necessary
	to evaluate the criterion (of goodness of prediction) on which it
	is based, and, to some extent, the computational effort involved.
	We review the most significant methods which have been proposed,
	evaluate them critically and choose those which seem to us most appropriate.
	For these chosen methods we discuss the computational procedures
	involved in their execution. Our conclusions and recommendations
	differ depending on whether the independent variables must be considered
	as fixed or whether it is possible to regard them as random. In the
	fixed case we recommend the `Cp' procedure (Mallows, 1966), or the
	`Ap' procedure (Allen, 1971), the latter if the user is prepared
	to incur the heavier calculation necessary to find an optimal (possibly
	different) subset of variables for every prediction. In the second
	case, if the independent variables can be considered as random, both
	the Cp and Ap would still be possible procedures, but we regard the
	`Sp' method (see e.g. Hocking, 1976) to be preferable in this situation.},

  abstract = {<p>Systems biology aims for building quantitative models to address
	unresolved issues in molecular biology. In order to describe the
	behavior of biological cells adequately, gene regulatory networks
	(GRNs) are intensively investigated. As the validity of models built
	for GRNs depends crucially on the kinetic rates, various methods
	have been developed to estimate these parameters from experimental
	data. For this purpose, it is favorable to choose the experimental
	conditions yielding maximal information. However, existing experimental
	design principles often rely on unfulfilled mathematical assumptions
	or become computationally demanding with growing model complexity.
	To solve this problem, we combined advanced methods for parameter
	and uncertainty estimation with experimental design considerations.
	As a showcase, we optimized three simulated GRNs in one of the challenges
	from the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods
	(DREAM). This article presents our approach, which was awarded the
	<italic>best performing procedure</italic> at the DREAM6 <italic>Estimation
	of Model Parameters</italic> challenge. For fast and reliable parameter
	estimation, local deterministic optimization of the likelihood was
	applied. We analyzed identifiability and precision of the estimates
	by calculating the profile likelihood. Furthermore, the profiles
	provided a way to uncover a selection of most informative experiments,
	from which the optimal one was chosen using additional criteria at
	every step of the design process. In conclusion, we provide a strategy
	for optimal experimental design and show its successful application
	on three highly nonlinear dynamic models. Although presented in the
	context of the GRNs to be inferred for the DREAM6 challenge, the
	approach is generic and applicable to most types of quantitative
	models in systems biology and other disciplines.</p>},

While significant progress has been made, effective experimental strategies for parameter identification and for distinguishing among alternative network topologies remain unclear. We approached these questions in an unbiased manner using a unique community-based approach in the context of the DREAM initiative (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessment of Methods). We created an in silico test framework under which participants could probe a network with hidden parameters by requesting a range of experimental assays; results of these experiments were simulated according to a model of network dynamics only partially revealed to participants.",

abstract = {Cell surface receptors convert extracellular cues into receptor activation, thereby triggering intracellular signaling networks and controlling cellular decisions. A major unresolved issue is the identification of receptor properties that critically determine processing of ligand-encoded information. We show by mathematical modeling of quantitative data and experimental validation that rapid ligand depletion and replenishment of the cell surface receptor are characteristic features of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR). The amount of Epo-EpoR complexes and EpoR activation integrated over time corresponds linearly to ligand input; this process is carried out over a broad range of ligand concentrations. This relation depends solely on EpoR turnover independent of ligand binding, which suggests an essential role of large intracellular receptor pools. These receptor properties enable the system to cope with basal and acute demand in the hematopoietic system.},

abstract = {Cellular signal transduction is governed by multiple feedback mechanisms to elicit robust cellular decisions. The specific contributions of individual feedback regulators, however, remain unclear. Based on extensive time-resolved data sets in primary erythroid progenitor cells, we established a dynamic pathway model to dissect the roles of the two transcriptional negative feedback regulators of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, CIS and SOCS3, in JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Facilitated by the model, we calculated the STAT5 response for experimentally unobservable Epo concentrations and provide a quantitative link between cell survival and the integrated response of STAT5 in the nucleus. Model predictions show that the two feedbacks CIS and SOCS3 are most effective at different ligand concentration ranges due to their distinct inhibitory mechanisms. This divided function of dual feedback regulation enables control of STAT5 responses for Epo concentrations that can vary 1000-fold in vivo. Our modeling approach reveals dose-dependent feedback control as key property to regulate STAT5-mediated survival decisions over a broad range of ligand concentrations.Mol Syst Biol. 7: 516},

abstract  ="Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are enzymes that catalyze ribosome-independent production of small peptides{,} most of which are bioactive. NRPSs act as peptide assembly lines where individual{,} often interconnected modules each incorporate a specific amino acid into the nascent chain. The modules themselves consist of several domains that function in the activation{,} modification and condensation of the substrate. NRPSs are evidently modular{,} yet experimental proof of the ability to engineer desired permutations of domains and modules is still sought. Here{,} we use a synthetic-biology approach to create a small library of engineered NRPSs{,} in which the domain responsible for carrying the activated amino acid (T domain) is exchanged with natural or synthetic T domains. As a model system{,} we employ the single-module NRPS IndC from Photorhabdus luminescens that produces the blue pigment indigoidine. As chassis we use Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that heterologous T domain exchange is possible{,} even for T domains derived from different organisms. Interestingly{,} substitution of the native T domain with a synthetic one enhanced indigoidine production. Moreover{,} we show that selection of appropriate inter-domain linker regions is critical for functionality. Taken together{,} our results extend the engineering avenues for NRPSs{,} as they point out the possibility of combining domain sequences coming from different pathways{,} organisms or from conservation criteria. Moreover{,} our data suggest that NRPSs can be rationally engineered to control the level of production of the corresponding peptides. This could have important implications for industrial and medical applications."}
